# A06 - REGEX(Regular expression)
## Athul sajikumar



# Description
A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

A regular expression, commonly known as regex, is a powerful tool used for manipulating strings in programming languages. In software development, strings are encountered everywhere, whether they contain numbers, alphabets, or special characters. As a result, string manipulation is a crucial aspect of software development.
Regex allows you to define patterns that describe specific sequences of characters. With regex, you can perform operations like searching for patterns, replacing text, splitting strings, and extracting specific parts of a string that match the defined pattern.

Every programming language typically has its own built-in support for regular expressions. They provide functions and libraries specifically designed for working with regex. These libraries often include methods such as search(), match(), findall(), and sub() to perform various operations using regular expressions.

Regex is not limited to programming languages alone. It can also be used in command-line utilities or text editors like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code. These tools often provide regex-based search and replace functionality, allowing you to work with strings in a text-based context.

String manipulation plays a crucial role in software development. Many programming tasks involve handling and manipulating strings, such as data validation, data extraction, text parsing, and formatting. Regular expressions provide a powerful and efficient way to accomplish these tasks with flexibility and precision.
