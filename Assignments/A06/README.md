## Description
Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, validate, and extract specific patterns of characters from text data.

Regular expressions consist of patterns made up of special characters and normal characters.you can use regular expressions to match email addresses, phone numbers, URLs, or even complex patterns like dates or HTML tags.

One of the most common use cases for regular expressions is data validation. You can validate user inputs, such as email addresses or passwords, by defining patterns that the input should match. If the input matches the pattern, it is considered valid; otherwise, it is deemed invalid.

Regular expressions also find great application in text processing tasks, such as searching and replacing specific patterns in a document or extracting relevant information from a large text dataset.

Every programming language typically has its own built-in support for regular expressions. They provide functions and libraries specifically designed for working with regex. These libraries often include methods such as search(), match(), findall(), and sub() to perform various operations using regular expressions.
